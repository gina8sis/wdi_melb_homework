#Stock App

- Build a Sinatra App that will take a stock symbol and display data about the stock
- The stock symbol should be inputted via a form
- The result should be rendered in the browswer with ERB.


###Suggested Approach

- Build a Sinatra application
  - Include:
    - app.rb
    - views/layout.erb
    - views/index.erb
    - public/styles.css
- Set up a welcome page
  - Display "Welcome to WDI Stocks" when there is `GET` request to `/`
- Define a method that makes a request to the `YahooFinance` api via the `YahooFinance` gem.
  - This method should take, as paramater, a stock ticker
  - This method should return data about the stock
  - Test this method manually in pry
- Display, for example, google's stock price when there is `GET` request to `/stocks/goog`
  - The file should be `show.erb`

####***Example api usage:***

```ruby

data = YahooFinance.historical_quotes("goog", Time::now-(24*60*60*10), Time::now)
```

```ruby

result = YahooFinance::get_quotes(YahooFinance::StandardQuote, 'MSFT')
```
